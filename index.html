         <h2>General Info</h2>
         <p>
            Hello my name is Kaegan Mcintosh I just graduated Neenah High School last year and am now attending Fox Valley Technical Collage for Software Development. In my free time i like to play video games and spend time with my friends and family. I also have 3 cats named Nova, Rosey, and Darcy who i also enjoy spending time with. As for my background with web design it's weird Neenah High didn't do much wit HTML in particular however they did lots with other various code languages such as c++ and python so while im not super familiar with the language itself i do have a grasp on certian terms and an idea on what they mean.

         <h2>Expectations</h2>
         <p>
           Generaly not very hard expectations for this course i'm just here to learn more about coding aswell as create some nice websites. I expect this course to be challenging and or interesting but much like in the way an escape room is challenging where ya it takes awhile to figure out or complete but it's still a fun and rewarding process. As for instructor expectations just being nice/kind and being there to answer questions my moms a former teacher so im generally pretty understanding about delays and anything else. If theres anything else feel free to ask me in person or email me im fine answering questions.
